### DEFINITIONS ###
There are 2 entities in the system:
	- a user
	- a parking place
	- the user queue

Shortcuts:
	- the user queue = the queue
	- a parking place = a place
		- an exclusive (parking) place = a parking place that is assigned to a host user but is never shared
		- a shared (parking) place = a parking place that is assigned to a host user and changed it status to free at least once
		- a free (shared parking) place = a shared parking place that has a free status for a moment
		- a booked (shared parking) place = a shared parking place that is booked by a user for a moment 
	- the system information = number of users, number of shared places, number of free shared places, number of users in the queue

There are 3 user roles in the system:
	- administrator (admin)
	- parking place owner (host)
	- shared parking place renter (driver)

### NOTIFICATIONS ###
As an administrator I should be notified
	if a user registers in the system
	if a host starts to share his parking place
	if a host works from home
	if a driver rents a place
	if a parking place changes status from free to booked and vise versa  
	  
As a host I should be notified
	if a driver rents my place
	if a renter cancels my place booking
	if an administator send a notification to every user

As a driver I should be notified
	if a free parking place appears (if I am in the user queue)
